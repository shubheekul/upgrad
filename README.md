# upgrad
Includes codes and hands on done during upGrad learning
This includes all the practice sessions tried out in Advanced Certificate Programme in Cloud Backend Development.
All the sessions are my personal coding practice that I tried out in different topics and modules.
These are NOT copied from anywhere neither include any test or exam related stuff that should be a concern for others.
